Description:API integration is a crucial aspect of modern software development, allowing applications to fetch and exchange data seamlessly from web-based services. Python, with its rich ecosystem of libraries, is well-suited for consuming RESTful APIs and transforming the retrieved data into meaningful visualizations. This task involves developing a Python application that interacts with a public REST API—such as one providing weather, financial, or real-time statistical data—fetching the information and presenting it in a structured and visually appealing format.

To achieve this, the program will use libraries like requests for handling HTTP requests and json for parsing API responses. The workflow will include:

1.Sending an HTTP GET request to a public REST API endpoint.

2.Capturing and validating the HTTP response, ensuring a successful request.

3.Parsing the JSON response and extracting key data points.

4.Structuring and processing the data for visualization.

5.Using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly to create graphs, charts, or interactive dashboards.

For example, if the application fetches weather data, it might visualize temperature trends, humidity levels, and wind speed variations over time. Similarly, for financial data, the program could generate stock market trends or currency exchange rate comparisons.

Error handling is an essential part of API integration, ensuring robustness against network failures, invalid responses, or unexpected data structures. The program will incorporate exception handling to manage HTTP errors, improper API responses, and missing data.

By integrating APIs and visualizing the retrieved information, this application demonstrates Python’s capability in data-driven decision-making, web-based service interaction, and analytical reporting. Whether analyzing trends, monitoring real-time data, or generating insights, API integration combined with visualization techniques enhances the understanding and usability of complex datasets.
